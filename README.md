This includes all the files and the code of my Learnings and recreational projects

### The Following are the few projects made out of curiosity which made me learn a lot about programming and Python.  ###
---  
## 1. Smart Dictionary ##
### A Dictionary Application that fetches the meaning of the words(for all words from a file) in real time, using an API ###
### The following are what make it kind of Smarter. ###
1. It gets all the possible meanings and stores them in a separate window.
2. It tracks the history and allow the saving of the meanings as well.
3. In place of a word, we can actually give a *file* that contains the words. It actually looks up all the words and saves 
the meanings of all of them in the current location.

1. A multi-featured programme that uses many of the concepts of python and database
  1. based on OOPS
  2. uses postgre database for content storage
  3. the code is divided into separate modueles for legibility
  4. good use of the standard libraries such os OS,SYS,RANDOM,TIME,DATETIME and many others
  5. equipped with logging information
2. The source of the data is Postgres and the all the updates are done at the data base level only
3. The best part is : the databast takes the data from a plain text file where the content is written as Q and A
4. it uses regular expression to parse the content and to distinguish a question and answer
5. Equipped with sound effect to offer a good experience (can be toggled OFF)
